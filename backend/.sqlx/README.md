# SQLx Offline Mode Cache

This directory contains pre-compiled query metadata for SQLx offline mode.

## What are these files?
- `query-*.json` - Cached metadata from SQL queries in the codebase
- Generated by: `cargo sqlx prepare --workspace`
- Used for: Compiling without a live database connection

## When to update?
Run this command whenever you:
- Add new SQL queries with `sqlx::query!()` macros
- Modify existing queries
- Change database schema (after running migrations)

```bash
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace
```

## Why are they tracked in git?
- Enables CI/CD builds without DATABASE_URL
- Allows contributors to build immediately
- Ensures reproducible builds across environments

## Environment Variables
To use offline mode (no database needed):
```bash
export SQLX_OFFLINE=true
cargo build
```

To force online mode (validate against live database):
```bash
export SQLX_OFFLINE=false
cargo build
